🚲 Used Bike Prices – EDA & Feature Engineering
📌 Overview

Analyzed 7,800+ used bike listings in India to understand factors influencing resale prices. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

🔑 Key Work

Cleaned missing/inconsistent data (mileage, power, location, kms_driven).

Engineered brand, CC, and bike_age features.

EDA showed:

Bajaj & Royal Enfield dominate resale.

150cc & 350cc bikes are most common.

First-owner bikes retain higher resale value.

Prices drop with higher mileage and older models.

Prepared dataset for regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

📊 Insights

Bike age, mileage, power, and CC are key predictors of price.

Premium brands (Royal Enfield, Yamaha) retain stronger resale.

Superbikes (>1000cc) are rare in the resale market.
